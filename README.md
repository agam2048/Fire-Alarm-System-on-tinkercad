# Fire-Alarm-System-on-tinkercad

This project was implement by me in the 3rd sem of my computer science engineering. The project is based on a fire alarm system designed as a Digital Electronic and Computer Architecture porject on the tinkercad inerface. 

Fire Alarm System is designed to alert us to an emergency so that we can take action to protect ourselves, staff and the general public.
Fire alarms are found in Offices, Factories, and public buildings, they are a part of our everyday routine but are often overlooked until there is an emergency at which point, they might just save our lives.

The attached project report will give a vivid description about the project.
